# Getting started with .NET Core 


### What on my box?
```
dotnet --version
```
![dotnet version](/images/ss-dotnet-version.png)


The dotnet sdk packages are located in `C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk`


```
dotnet --info
```
![dotnet info](/images/ss-dotnet-info.png)

Note that .NET Core versions are specific to the Visual Studio installation. In my case, I was using Visual Studio 2017 CE that could not be used with .NET Core 3.x. prompting me to install VS 2019.
